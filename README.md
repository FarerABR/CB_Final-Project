# First Semester Final Project

this is the final project for my first semester as a CE student


so this is my final project
the ui is simple so i dont need to explain it

but there are somethings to be mentioned

you can't use function along with a phrase
but you can use a phrase inside of a function
for example: sin(12+4\*2(25)-1
(you don't need to add the close bracet at the end)

and the little rad button changes whenever you click it
so it's 3 cases: radian, degree, gradian

for using log and radical function you need to type the base at first
after that click on the function button and type the input, and it also can be a phrase
for example: 2radical4 or 3log54/2

and for power function you do the same
which means base at first, then click pow button, then power
and base can be a phrase too

for using the base converter, simply type the input in first text box,
then current base in the second text box,
and new base in the third text box
then click the base convert button
for example: "8" from "10" to "2"

and i think its now clear how the equation function works

and finally for using the angle converter, just type the input and select the convert function

also the app can only add and subtract two "int" big number
so it can't multiply or divide

there is 3 header file in Additional_Files folder
GetNumber do the main operation, it gets a string and simplifies the phrase and use Validator file to
confirm if the input is valid, and then use the Function file to do all the math, i could make another header for (+-\*/)
but at that time i didn't know it's gonna be a mess

bye i guess :)
